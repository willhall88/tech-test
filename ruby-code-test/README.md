# Ruby Technical Test  

**This test is to produce a program that simulates a simple interactive graphical editor. More details on how the program functions are at the bottom of the README. **

I started off this test by writing down what classes there should be and what responsibilities they should have. I began with creating a pixel object which would make up the image. The pixel was responsible for knowing what colour it was,  later when I was creating the fill image method I realised it needed to know its own position within the image as well. The image class was built up out of nested arrays of pixels and was responsible for changing the image of pixels. The commands class was responsible for interpreting the user input and communicating those inputs to the image class.
I wrote rspec tests to help build up each part of the program before it was ready to be tested manually. When I had the program running I could then test true user input and could find any edge cases that might crash the program.

## Input

The input consists of a line containing a sequence of commands. Each command is represented by a single capital letter at the start of the line. 
Arguments to the command are separated by spaces and follow the command character.

Pixel co-ordinates are represented by a pair of integers: 

1. A column number between _1_ and _M_, and 
2. A row number between _1_ and _N_. 

Where _1 <= M_, _N <= 250_. 

The origin sits in the upper-left of the table.  
Colours are specified by capital letters. 

## Commands

The editor supports 7 commands:

1. `I M N`. Create a new _M x N_ image with all pixels coloured white (O).
2. `C`. Clears the table, setting all pixels to white (O).
3. `L X Y C`. Colours the pixel (_X,Y_) with colour _C_.
4. `V X Y1 Y2 C`. Draw a vertical segment of colour _C_ in column X between rows _Y1_ and _Y2_ (inclusive).
5. `H X1 X2 Y C`. Draw a horizontal segment of colour _C_ in row _Y_ between columns _X1_ and _X2_ (inclusive).
6. `F X Y C`. Fill the region _R_ with the colour _C_. _R_ is defined as: Pixel (_X,Y_) belongs to _R_. Any other pixel which is the same colour as (_X,Y_) and shares a common side with any pixel in _R_ also belongs to this region.
7. `S`. Show the contents of the current image
8. `X`. Terminate the session
